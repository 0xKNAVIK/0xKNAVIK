# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Iâ€™m 0xKNAVIK
This GitHub is dedicated to my journey in cybersecurity â€” a field I'm deeply passionate about.

I chose the name 0xKNAVIK because it feels more personal and unique than my real name.
But if you manage to uncover it... well, congratulations â€” it's Nicolas Kaenan Silveira. ðŸ˜‰

Here youâ€™ll find tools, scripts, experiments, and personal research as I grow in this career.
Feel free to explore, learn, or even reach out.

ðŸ”§ Skills & Interests
- Developer
> I'm also studying software development, with experience in Java, Angular, and Spring Boot.

- Curious by nature
> Whenever I encounter problems, I strive to understand them deeply â€” well enough to solve them more than once and learn from them.
